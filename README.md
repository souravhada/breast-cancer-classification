## Project Details
### Dataset
For this project, I'm utilizing the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset available in scikit-learn. This dataset contains features extracted from digitized images of breast mass fine needle aspirates (FNA). These features describe various characteristics of cell nuclei present in the images, such as radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, compactness, concavity, and more.

### Goals
-Explore and preprocess the dataset to ensure its suitability for training machine learning models.
-Implement and compare the performance of Decision Trees, Random Forest, and AdaBoost classifiers for breast cancer classification.
-Fine-tune the models to improve their predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities.
-Evaluate the models using appropriate performance metrics and visualization techniques.
